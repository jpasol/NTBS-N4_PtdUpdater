Nothing to see here

What this application does is extracts all the arrastre-paid containers in NTBS via Import, Export, and Special Services, and updates the Active Units in N4, and then extends their storage paid through date accordingly.

Note: This does not include Manual invoiced additional storage that has no explicitly defined container number.
